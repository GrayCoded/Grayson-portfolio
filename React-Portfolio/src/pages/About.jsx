                Hello! and welcome to my professional portfolio. My name is Daniel Grayson and I am going to introduce myself
                to you. Originally from <a href="https://www.barrhead.ca/" >Barrhead</a>, Alberta growing up on a farm with aspirations to move to the city and make
                something of myself the process took some interesting turns. From working in the oil field for 10 years for companies like <a href="https://www.weatherford.com/">Weatherford</a> as a wireline operator, to working as territory sales manager for craft beer with
                <a href="https://www.beerthirst.com/">Beerthirst</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, to present and thousands of kilometers from where I started and working toward a career as a software developer in Fredericton, New Brunswick.
                I am bringing a creative and passionate approach to everything I do. I look forward to the next problem to solve and the next project to work on.
                With the experience and knowledge I have acquired over the years, I am confident that I can meet any challenge that comes my way.
                I hope that you enjoy my portfolio.
